# Almondala Mobile

This repo is a testbed for working on a mobile-friendly version of my Almondala project. (Original repo [here](https://github.com/pjtunstall/almondala).) In this one, I renamed the `public` folder `docs` to allow me to deploy from it to GitHub Pages, since that platform doesn't have the option to deploy from public.

Plan:

- Portrait: make sure all buttons are visible. (Done, in two rows.)
- Portrait: eliminate the 'deadzone' where the window is narrow enough to route to this site, but not narrow enough to trigger wider buttons in two rows.
- Landscape: make buttons bigger. (Use two columns?)
- I could use the empty space better. The canvas could be put off center if that helps and looks alright.
- Since we don't have the button instructions on hover, the info button has to be more comprehensive. Or instructions for each button could appear when it's pressed.
- Optional: add more controls, e.g. drag to reposition.
- Optional: a reset button, since spacebar to reset is not available, although the page can be reloaded.
